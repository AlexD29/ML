Wheat Kernel Dataset
The dataset comprises kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian. The examined group consists of 70 elements for each variety, randomly selected for the experiment. The dataset is derived from high-quality visualization of the internal kernel structure using a soft X-ray technique. This technique is non-destructive and more cost-effective compared to other sophisticated imaging methods such as scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. The studies were conducted using combine-harvested wheat grain from experimental fields explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin.

Purpose of the Dataset
The dataset is suitable for tasks related to classification and cluster analysis. The target attribute for classification is the Seed Type.

Attribute Information
To construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured, all of which are real-valued continuous:
